          <h4>repository</h4>
          <p>
            A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to
            imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the
            project files (including documentation), and stores each file's
            revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and
            can be either public or private.
          </p>
          <h4>branch</h4>
          <p>
            A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained
            within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main
            branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live"
            version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can
            merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes.
          </p>
          <h4>clone</h4>
          <p>
            A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer
            instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making
            that copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your
            preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without
            having to be online. The repository you cloned is still connected to
            the remote version so that you can push your local changes to the
            remote to keep them synced when you're online.

          <h4>commit</h4>
          <p>
            A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set
            of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a
            unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep
            record of the specific changes committed along with who made them
            and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief
            description of what changes were made.
          </p>
          <h4>push</h4>
          <p>
            To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository
            on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you
            can push those changes so that others may access them.
          </p>
          <h4>pull</h4>
          <p>
            Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them.
            For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both
            working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy
            so that it's up to date. See also fetch.
          </p>
          <h4>merge</h4>
          <p>
            Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or
            from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a
            "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or
            via the command line. A merge can be done through a pull request via
            the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or
            can always be done via the command line.
