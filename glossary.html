          <h4>repository</h4>
          <p>
            A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to
            imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the
            project files (including documentation), and stores each file's
            revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and
            can be either public or private.
          </p>
          <h4>branch</h4>
          <p>
            A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained
            within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main
            branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live"
            version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can
            merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes.
          </p>
          <h4>clone</h4>
          <p>
            A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer
            instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making
            that copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your
            preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without
            having to be online. The repository you cloned is still connected to
            the remote version so that you can push your local changes to the
            remote to keep them synced when you're online.
