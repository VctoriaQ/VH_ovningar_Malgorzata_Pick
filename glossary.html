          <h4>repository</h4>
          <p>
            A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to
            imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the
            project files (including documentation), and stores each file's
            revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and
            can be either public or private.
          </p>
          <h4>branch</h4>
          <p>
            A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained
            within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main
            branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live"
            version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can
            merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes.
          </p>
          <h4>clone</h4>
          <p>
            A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer
            instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making
            that copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your
            preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without
            having to be online. The repository you cloned is still connected to
            the remote version so that you can push your local changes to the
            remote to keep them synced when you're online.
          </p>
          <h4>commit</h4>
          <p>
            A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set
            of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a
            unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep
            record of the specific changes committed along with who made them
            and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief
            description of what changes were made.
          </p>
          <h4>push</h4>
          <p>
            To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository
            on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you
            can push those changes so that others may access them.
          </p>
          <h4>pull</h4>
          <p>
            Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them.
            For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both
            working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy
            so that it's up to date. See also fetch.
          </p>
          <h4>merge</h4>
          <p>
            Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or
            from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a
            "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or
            via the command line. A merge can be done through a pull request via
            the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or
            can always be done via the command line.
          </p>

          <h4>Working Directory</h4>
          <p>
            Working Direktory is the area outside the ".git" directory and here
            stores all files from the project. We manipulate files here and here
            saves the last version of every file. Git detects all new files and
            all changes.
          </p>
          <h4>staging</h4>
          <p>
            A way to test modifications before they are applied to your actual
            GitHub Enterprise instance.
          </p>
          <h4>HEAD</h4>
          <p>
            A defined commit of a branch, usually the most recent commit at the
            tip of the branch.
          </p>
          <h4>revert</h4>
          <p>
            When you revert a pull request on GitHub, a new pull request is
            automatically opened, which has one commit that reverts the merge
            commit from the original merged pull request. In Git, you can revert
            commits with git revert.
          </p>
          <h4>reset</h4>
          <p>
            A hard reset can be done if you're the only one using the local and
            remote repository, or if the reset removes commits that have not yet
            been pushed to a shared remote. In this case, you're the only one
            affected by the hard reset, so it's relatively safe to do. Just make
            sure you want drop the commits in question before you do the reset.
          </p>
          <h4>Skillnade mellan fork och clone</h4>
          <p>
            Både Git fork och clone skaparar kopior av det reposetory men de
            erbjuder olika nivåer av åtkomst isolring och kontroll över. En fork
            skapar en självständig kopia av den orginala reposetory. Medans En
            clone skapar en länkad kopia som är synkroniserad med orginal
            repository.
