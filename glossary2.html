          <h4>commit</h4>
          <p>
            A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set
            of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a
            unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep
            record of the specific changes committed along with who made them
            and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief
            description of what changes were made.
          </p>
          <h4>push</h4>
          <p>
            To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository
            on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you
            can push those changes so that others may access them.
          </p>
          <h4>pull</h4>
          <p>
            Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them.
            For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both
            working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy
            so that it's up to date. See also fetch.
          </p>
          <h4>merge</h4>
          <p>
            Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or
            from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a
            "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or
            via the command line. A merge can be done through a pull request via
            the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or
            can always be done via the command line.
